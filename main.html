    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph: Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. Analyzing time complexity helps us determine how efficient an algorithm is when processing large datasets.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph: Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of the size of its input. It is often represented using Big O notation, such as <code>O(n)</code>, to describe how memory usage scales with input size.
